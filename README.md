Until just a few years ago, astronomers had only confirmed the presence of fewer than a thousand exoplanets. Then came the Kepler mission, and the number of exoplanets exploded. The Kepler mission is sadly over in 2018, but the TESS mission or Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has taken its place and is regularly finding new exoplanets in the night sky. TESS is monitoring the brightness of stars for periodic drops caused by planet transits. The TESS mission is finding planets ranging from small, rocky worlds to giant planets, showcasing the diversity of planets in the galaxy.

I wanted to see if I could look at the available exoplanet data and make predictions about which planets might be hospitable to life. The data made publicly available by NASA is beautiful in that it contains many useful features. The goal is to create a model that can predict the existence of an Exoplanet, utilizing the flux (light intensity) readings from 3198 different stars over time.

Our Solar System formed around 4600 million years ago. We know this from the study of meteorites and radioactivity. It all began with a cloud of gas and dust. A nearby supernova explosion probably perturbed the calm cloud, which then started to contract due to gravity, forming a flat, rotating disk with most of the material concentrated in the center: the protosun. Later, gravity pulled the rest of the material into clumps and rounded some of them, forming the planets and dwarf planets. The leftovers resulted in comets, asteroids, and meteoroids.

But what are Exoplanets?

Exoplanets are planets beyond our own solar system. Thousands have been discovered in the past two decades, mostly with NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope.

These exoplanets come in a huge variety of sizes and orbits. Some are gigantic planets hugging close to their parent stars; others are icy, some rocky. NASA and other agencies are looking for a special kind of planet: one that’s the same size as Earth, orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone.

The habitable zone is the area around a star where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of surrounding planets. Imagine if Earth was where Pluto is. The Sun would be barely visible (about the size of a pea) and Earth’s ocean and much of its atmosphere would freeze

Why even search for exoplanets?

There are about 100,000,000,000 stars in our Galaxy, the Milky Way. How many exoplanets — planets outside of the Solar System — do we expect to exist? Why are some stars surrounded by planets? How diverse are planetary systems? Does this diversity tell us something about the process of planet formation? These are some of the many questions that motivate the study of exoplanets. Some exoplanets may have the necessary physical conditions (amount and quality of light from the star, temperature, atmospheric composition) for the existence of complex organic chemistry and perhaps for the development of Life (which may be quite different from Life on Earth).

However, detecting exoplanets is no simple task. We may have imagined life on other planets in books and film for centuries, but detecting actual exoplanets is a recent phenomenon. Planets on their own emit very little if any light. We can only see Jupiter or Venus in the night sky because they reflect the sun’s light. If we were to look at an exoplanet (the nearest one is over 4 light-years away), it would be very close to a brilliantly lit star, making the planet impossible to see.

Scientists discovered a very efficient way to study these occurrences; planets themselves do not emit light, but the stars around which they orbit do. Considering this fact into account scientists at NASA developed a method which they called Transit method in which a digital-camera-like technology is used to detect and measure tiny dips in a star’s brightness as a planet crosses in front of the star. With observations of transiting planets, astronomers can calculate the ratio of a planet’s radius to that of its star — essentially the size of the planet’s shadow — and with that ratio, they can calculate the planet’s size.
Kepler Space Telescope’s primary method of searching for planets was the “Transit” method.

Transit method: In the diagram below, a star is orbited by a planet. From the graph, it is visible that the starlight intensity drops because it is partially obscured by the planet, given our position. The starlight rises back to its original value once the planets crosses in front of the star.
