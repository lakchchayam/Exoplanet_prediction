There are about 100,000,000,000 stars in our Galaxy, the Milky Way. How many exoplanets — planets outside of the Solar System — do we expect to exist? Why are some stars surrounded by planets? How diverse are planetary systems? Does this diversity tell us something about the process of planet formation? These are some of the many questions that motivate the study of exoplanets. Some exoplanets may have the necessary physical conditions (amount and quality of light from the star, temperature, atmospheric composition) for the existence of complex organic chemistry and perhaps for the development of Life (which may be quite different from Life on Earth).

However, detecting exoplanets is no simple task. We may have imagined life on other planets in books and film for centuries, but detecting actual exoplanets is a recent phenomenon. Planets on their own emit very little if any light. We can only see Jupiter or Venus in the night sky because they reflect the sun’s light. If we were to look at an exoplanet (the nearest one is over 4 light-years away), it would be very close to a brilliantly lit star, making the planet impossible to see.
